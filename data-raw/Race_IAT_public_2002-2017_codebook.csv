Codebook for variables in Race IAT.public.2002-2017.sav,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1). Use the Filter on the Source cell to select the set of variables that you are interested in. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"      Source code: exp = explicit questions, sssn = session variables, iat = IAT variables, dbrf = debriefing variables, dem = demographics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"      Color coding: blue = from iat.txt; green = not in the raw data, computed in the syntax; orange = from explicit.txt; purple = from sessions.txt",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2). Subjects may not have all the variables due to change of the experiment, skipping questions, or IAT incompletion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3). Only subjects who completed the IAT blocks from the beginning to the end (200 trials) has IAT related variables. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Please note that after 9/26/2016 the IAT changed to 188 trials - block 5 was cut from 40 trials back to 28 trials due to order effects. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"4). Some of the variables have scale changed over years. In the Notes column, two types of comments about the scales can be found: ""Scale changed one time over years"", or specific description about the change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"      Accordingly, the Notes column also describes variables as ""renamed"", or specific description.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5). Variables names that have brown background were randomly assigned to subjects. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6).
