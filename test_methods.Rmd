```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# this will run .R files to get function into environment
source("R/participants_asglue.R")
source("R/participants.R")
source("R/corrsig.R")
source("R/correffectsize.R")
data(raceiatdat)
library(numform)
```
```{r include = FALSE}
participants(data = raceiatdat)
pctwhite <- participants(data = raceiatdat)
```

There were `r nrow(raceiatdat)` participants. 
The sample was `r pctwhite`% White.

The average IAT score was `r round(mean(raceiatdat$Implicit),2)`.

```{r include = FALSE}
corrtest <- cor.test(raceiatdat$Explicit, raceiatdat$politics, method = "pearson", use = "complete.obs")
correffectsize <- correffectsize(corrtest$estimate)
corrsig <- corrsig(corrtest$p.value)
```

There was a  `r correffectsize` correlation between political ideology and scores on the Race IAT, *r* = `r numform::f_num(corrtest$estimate, digits = 3)`, *p* = `r corrsig`.
