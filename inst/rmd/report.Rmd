**Method**

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# this will run .R files to get function into environment
library(numform)
library(projectimplicit)
```

```{r include = FALSE}
workingdata <- raceiatdat8000

participants(data = workingdata)
pctwhite <- participants(data = workingdata)
```

There were `r nrow(workingdata)` participants. 
The sample was `r pctwhite`% White.

**Results**

```{r include = FALSE}
abspref3 <- abspref3(iatscore = mean(workingdata$implicit))
```

The average IAT score was `r round(mean(workingdata$Implicit),2)`, which indicates `r abspref3`.

```{r include = FALSE}
corrtest <- cor.test(workingdata$explicit, workingdata$politics, method = "pearson", use = "complete.obs")
correffectsize <- correffectsize(corrtest$estimate)
corrsig <- corrsig(corrtest$p.value)
```

There was a  `r correffectsize` correlation between political ideology and scores on the Race IAT, *r* = `r numform::f_num(corrtest$estimate, digits = 3)`, *p* = `r corrsig`.
